# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a text-based implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game in Python. In this game, the player competes against the computer in a 3x3 grid. The player and the computer take turns placing their respective markers ('X' for the player and 'O' for the computer) in empty cells of the grid. The first player to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line with their marker wins the game. If all cells are filled without any player achieving a winning combination, the game ends in a tie.

## How to Play

1. Run the `tic_tac_toe.py` file using a Python interpreter.
2. Follow the prompts to input the row and column numbers (1-3) to make your move.
3. The computer will make its move automatically.
4. Continue alternating turns with the computer until a player wins or the game ends in a tie.
5. The game will display the final board and the outcome of the game (win, lose, or tie).

Enjoy playing Tic Tac Toe against the computer!
